# RL-Pendulum
 This project aims to delve into the realm of reinforcement learning by investigating and implementing different Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic architectures. The focus is on utilizing these architectures to tackle the challenging pendulum environment, a classic problem in control theory.
